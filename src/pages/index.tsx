        100 years ago, the land at 123 Main Street in Landborough was a pasture; in the 1960s, it was developed into a small shopping plaza; by 2000, the plaza was struggling. In 2015, a new chapter began when this land was redeveloped as a small residential building. The new apartments/condos are home to people who might otherwise not have had a chance to live in or stay in Landborough. The apartments use less energy than single family homes and didnâ€™t require the destruction of natural areas. People who live there can walk to get a cup of coffee, or buy a gallon of milk, or to get on the bus, so they are not contributing to traffic congestion. Tax revenue is higher than it was before. By replacing a shabby retail plaza, the new building enhanced the character of the town.
